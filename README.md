**Objectives**

I am currently pursuing the CompTIA Pentest+ certification and have incorporated TryHackMe into my studies to enhance my hands-on experience with penetration testing.  One module that particularly captivated me is the **Governance & Regulation** section which provided invaluable insights.  In this project, I will outline key concepts I have learned and demonstrate how I plan to apply them as I progress in my cybersecurity career.
